Exercises for Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning

## Goal:
1. Implement the algorithms manually, i.e. without scikit-learn & TensorFlow
2. Repeat with scikit-learn
3. For exercises with Neural Network: repeat with TensorFlow

## Software:
Python3 within [Anaconda](www.anaconda.com) package is all we need.
